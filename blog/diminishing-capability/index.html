  <p>Today with advancement in technology humans have achieved so much. Technology took us
to the moon, now we are pushing further into space. We can travel to farthest destinations in matter of hours, which used to took days.</p>

<p>Most important advancement has been in the field of communication, If some important incident happens in USA, I will usually hear about it in news, even though there is 12 hour timezone gap.</p>

<p>But while technology is leading us to a brighter future as species there is something important still missing. We usually find ourselves in need of some alone time, away from all
technology. This drives us to camping trips, booking remote cabins or even go fishing. With all this advancement our ability as individual human is certainly diminishing.</p>

<p>In India there is a very famous temple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagannath_Temple,_Puri">Jagannath Temple</a>. About 8 years ago a stone slab weighing more than 1000 Kg (Or 2200 lbs) <a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/content/201715/content/219455/writing-rules-retailing.html">fell from it</a>. No type of crane could put it back. This temple is about 800 years old. If you ask someone to build it without any modern equipments today, it seems impossible. But 800 years ago, it was built without any modern equipments. This was possible by resolve and sheer human capacity.</p>

<p>If you observe, in this age we all want to just relax. We need more breaks than ever, we don&rsquo;t want sit in a car without A.C. on. Our dependence on medicine has also increased, people are demanding more <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/stewardship-report/pdf/stewardship-report.pdf">anti biotics</a> than ever. Increased volumes for these medicines are in-fact fueled by predatory prescriptions but actual use is also on the rise.</p>

<p>Our phones are stealing our attention, When I initially started using mobile phone I used to remember lots of phone numbers. Today I just remember by own and one landline number.</p>

<p>So if human capability is decreasing, is technology is to blame? No, rather irresponsible use of technology is to blame.</p>

<p>First if you talk about physical capacity, as my teacher once told now a days human is eating poison, all crops all sprayed with poison. Fruits ripen with chemicals. When you eat such things poison will surely affect you as well.</p>

<p>Mental capacity has been decreasing as well, today we see lot more cases of stress and mental problems.</p>

<p>We need to find sustainable growth mechanisms, which focus on human well being not mass production. Good health and stress free environment should be our primary goal. These things will lead to better society and productivity.</p>
