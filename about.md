Hello there, I am Sushant, currently living in [Chandigarh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh)

I am an ECMAScript / JavaScript programmer working on Node.JS / React / Angular / Sequelize. I used to work with PHP (Laravel / Yii) initially, then found interest in Node.JS platform.

Try to help OSS community whenever I find some spare time. I am a core contributor at
[Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize). I also contribute to [node-mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2)

This is my blog which I use to record things I am currently working on or learning.
