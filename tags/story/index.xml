      <description>Yet another short story, I remembered this evening.
The Story Once there was a teacher who used to make mud toys. He also had one student, who was learning this art from him. Both used to make mud toys and sell them in market. This is how they made their living.
There was an interesting thing about this student teacher pair. Every toy that teacher used to sell was priced at ₹5, on other hand toys made by his student used to fetch much more price.</description>

Satan told her, “You’ve been a greedy, selfish woman all your life.</description>
